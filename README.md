 This peroject uses the MURA dataset to present a hybrid deep learning
 technique for multi-class categorization of anomalies in the upper
 extremity, encompassing the wrist, humerus, and elbow. This
 study uses pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
 such as Visual Geometry Group (VGG19), Dense Convolutional
 Network (DenseNet121), and Residual Network (ResNet50), as
 well as customized CNN architectures, to classify abnormalities
 in upper extremity radiographs. These models are tailored to the
 anomaly detection job using transfer learning, resulting in ac
curate abnormality identification and localization. Furthermore,
 heatmap visualization techniques are used to improve anomaly
 identification outcomes, giving clinicians interpretable data for
 analyzing probable abnormalities in X-ray pictures.
