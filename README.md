 This peroject uses the MURA dataset to present a hybrid deep learning
 technique for multi-class categorization of anomalies in the upper
 extremity, encompassing the wrist, humerus, and elbow. This
 study uses pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
 such as Visual Geometry Group (VGG19), Dense Convolutional
 Network (DenseNet121), and Residual Network (ResNet50), as
 well as customized CNN architectures, to classify abnormalities
 in upper extremity radiographs. These models are tailored to the
 anomaly detection job using transfer learning, resulting in ac
curate abnormality identification and localization. Furthermore,
 heatmap visualization techniques are used to improve anomaly
 identification outcomes, giving clinicians interpretable data for
 analyzing probable abnormalities in X-ray pictures.

 The following are our project’s primary goals: 
i. To design and train a hybrid deep learning model capable of 
accurately detecting abnormalities simultaneously in the elbow, 
humerus, and wrist region. 
ii. To implement advanced region-specific localization capabilities within 
the hybrid model to pinpoint the exact location of abnormalities 
within each region. 
iii. To evaluate the model’s performance through metrics like accuracy, 
precision, re- call, and F1-score for abnormality detections in 
various regions
