# Hybrid Model for Abnormalities Detection in Upper Extremity Radiographs



## Abstract
This project uses the MURA dataset to present a hybrid deep learning technique for multi-class categorization of anomalies in the upper extremity, encompassing the wrist, humerus, and elbow. This study uses pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as Visual Geometry Group (VGG19), Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), and Residual Network (ResNet50), as well as customized CNN architectures, to classify abnormalities in upper extremity radiographs. These models are tailored to the anomaly detection job using transfer learning, resulting in accurate abnormality identification and localization. Furthermore, heatmap visualization techniques are used to improve anomaly identification outcomes, giving clinicians interpretable data for analyzing probable abnormalities in X-ray pictures.

## Key Features
- Utilizes the MURA dataset for training and evaluation
- Implements pre-trained CNNs including VGG19, DenseNet121, and ResNet50
- Customizes CNN architectures for anomaly detection in upper extremity radiographs
- Employs transfer learning for model adaptation to the anomaly detection task
- Utilizes heatmap visualization for improved anomaly localization

## Methodology
The methodology involves preprocessing the dataset, training deep learning models tailored to specific body regions, and generating heatmap visualizations for anomaly localization. Various metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 measure are used to evaluate the model performance.

## Results
The experimental results demonstrate significant classification accuracies across different body regions, with the hybrid model achieving true positive rates of approximately 93% for the elbow, 87% for the humerus, and 90% for the wrist. Heatmap visualizations provide insights into the specific areas identified as anomalies by the model.

## Conclusion and Future Work
The project highlights the potential of deep learning techniques to improve diagnostic capabilities for musculoskeletal illnesses. Future work includes investigating advanced architectures and expanding localization skills to varied patient populations.
